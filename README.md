# Stock-Market-Analysis

This is my 1st mini project using Python perfomed in Edureka Data Science Internship Program.

Finance is probably one of the first to catch on to this trend with a rise in the penetration of analytics into many aspects of our lives. However, we will analyse data from the stock market for some technology stocks such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft

Objective:
Use Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn and Matplotlib to extract and analyse the information, visualise it, and look at different ways to analyse the risk of a stock, based on its performance history.

Here is some of the Questions we shall try to answer

*   Read the Data from Yahoo finance website directly
*   Perform cleaning
*   What was the change in stock price over time?
*   Visualize the change in a stock’s volume being traded, over time?
*   What was the moving average of various stocks?
*   What was the daily return average of a stock?
*   Add a new column ‘Trend’ whose values are based on the 'Daily Return'
*   Visualize the trend frequency through a Pie Chart
*   What was the correlation between daily returns of different stocks?
